              <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi, I am <a href="https://www.facebook.com/steven785">Steven Son B. Nava</a>. I am currently taking up Batchelor of Science in Information Technology
                at Cordova Public College, Cordova, Cebu. I aspire to become a Web Developer and I strive to be great in my field.
                I have fair experience in web developing, and still learning more stuff about it. I am hardworking as well,
                which in this case, should be a great asset since this field usually takes much time and effort to progress.
                
              </p>

              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Hello, I am <a href="https://www.facebook.com/subtlesubway">Ralph O. Menguito</a>. I am currently taking up Batchelor of Science in Information Technology
                at Cordova Public College, Cordova, Cebu. I aspire to become a Graphics Designer since Art is always my
                forte. I took an Animation Major Course back when I was in Senior High School which is pretty useful today
                and I also have a rather artistic outlook and approach in life. I am passionate with what I do and I strive
                to become what my younger self wanted me to be.
